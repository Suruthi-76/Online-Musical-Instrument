<h3>IMPORTANT SHIPPING UPDATE:</h3>
<div>
<b>FEE:</b> Bajaao has always maintained a free standard shipping policy to the majority of the locations but unfortunately, due to the ongoing Corona pandemic this policy has had to be changed with effect May 6, 2020. This is because courier partners are encountering significantly higher operations costs shipping to most red/orange/green zones, and are passing on these costs to Bajaao.

<br>1)As a result, we are charging a portion of these costs to customers via a modest shipping fee on every order placed on our website until further notice.<br>2) We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this difficult time. Please be assured that we are doing everything possible to ensure that your product reaches you in a timely manner.

<br>3)We are also ensuring your safety by disinfecting all packages before, during, and after packing.

<h3>HOW FAST DO I GET MY GEAR?</h3>

<b>DISPATCH</b> : Please review the product page. It indicates the number of business days within which that product is expected to ship, reflecting our current order backlog of 2 days plus (in some cases) additional sourcing/processing time for certain products. 

<br><br><b>SHIPPING :</b> 1)Please expect delays beyond our dispatch date. Once orders are dispatched, couriers are experiencing additional transit and zone-specific delays. This is because prevailing state and local lock-down rulings are frequently changing, which in turn is impacting their delivery timelines to you.

<br>2)It is our current experience that you need to expect shipping delays even beyond the ETA on your courierâ€™s shipment tracking page.
